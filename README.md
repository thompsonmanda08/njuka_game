# njuka_game

A game of cards where the winner is first person to hold a hand of two identical cards and two other cards that are of sequential values i.e have a difference of one

To start the game you need a standard deck of cards minus the picture cards (jack, queen and king) thus the deck will have have 40 cards(10 per suit)


Next you need to determine the number of players participating in the game


After that, shuffle the deck of cards and deal each player a set of three cards


Shuffle the deck again and let the players take turns drawing one card at a time from the top of the deck


Every time a player draws a card, check if the player has won based on the criteria established in the introduction, else, the player is required to drop one card from their hand before the next player can take their turn to draw a card from the deck.


** Extra Challenge ** 
BEYOND THE BASICS:
-> allow a player to winner via number line

-> allow a player to win by a card dropped by another palyer

-> allow two players to swap cards

-> in the case that a player draws a card and their hand consists of 2 pairs of numerically identical cards e.g (two 2s and two 8s) allow the player to drop any two cards and draw one from the deck

-> Introduce the 'K', 'Q' and 'J' to make a complete deck of cards.

-> Allow players to win with special rules of the K, Q and J cards.

-Last but not least - introduce the joker card
